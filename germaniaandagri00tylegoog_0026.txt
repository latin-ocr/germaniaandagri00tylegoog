ln is the office of genius end learning, ee ol light, to illustrate
other things, and not itsclf. The writers, who, of all others
perhaps, heve told us most of the world, just es it has been
end is, heve told us least ol themselves. Their character wo
may infer, with niore or less exactrices, lrorn their werke, but
their liistory is unwritten and mustlor ever remain so. Homer,
though, perhaps, the only one who has been argued out ot
existence, is by no means the only one whose age and birth·
” place have been disputed. The nonve place oi Tacitus is

mere marteres conjecture. His perentage is not certainly ’

known. The tinio olbis birth and the year ol his doeth are
ascertained only by approximation, end very low incidente ure
recorded in the history ol his¹ life; still we know the period in
which he lived, the influonoes under which his character wus
developed and matured, end the circumsunces‘under which he
wrote his immortal werke. In short', we know hie tiones,
though we oen* scaroely gether* up enough to denominate his
lie,· end tha times in which an author lived, are osten an
important, not to say, essentiel means of elucidating his
writings.
