the simple laets of the narrative. Erery thing produces attachment
every thing eonveys instruction. The reader loves Agricola, admirer
him, oeneeives a passion for him, uoeompanies him in his campaigns
ahares in his disgrace and profits by his example. hbe interest goes

pressed in English: down-hill and opengrouud work.
