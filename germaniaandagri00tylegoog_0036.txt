soll and delicate finish despisad. We leel, that wa have gained
not a little insight into the character oi those mon, who are
barely introduced in the extem books oi Tacitus, but whose
history is given in the books that are lost. Men ol inferior
rank even, who appear on the stage only lor a short tima
develope strongly marked characters, which are drawn with
dramatic distinotness and power, while yet the thread oi history
is never broken, the dignity ol history never aacdficed. And
those Emperors, whose history is preserved entire—with them
we leel acquaintod, we know the controlling principles, as well
as the leading events ol their lives, and we feel sure that we
could predict how they would act, under almost any imaginable
circumstances.

In alaithiul pertraiture oi the private and public life ol the
degenerata Romans, there was much to call ior the hand ol a
master in satire. And we find in the glowing sketches ol our
author, all the vigor and pointel a Juvenal, without his vulgarity
and obscenity; all the buming indignation which the Latin is
so peculiarly capable oi expressing, with all the vigor and
stateliness by which the same langnage is equally characterired.
Tacitus has been sometimes represented aa a very Diogenes,
for carping and saraam-a very Aristophanes, to blacken
character with ridicule and reproach. But he is as iar removed

’ from the cynic or tho buffoou, as from the panegyrist or the
flatterer. He is not the indiscriminate admirer that Plutarch
was. Nor is he such a universal hater as Sallust. lt is the t
fault oi the dmes that heis obliged to deal so much in censure.

ll there ever were perfect monsters on earth. such were several
oi the Roman Emperors. Yet Tacitus describes few, ii any,
ol diem without some oi the traits oi humanity. He gives us ,
in his history neither demens nor gods, but veritable meu and--
women ln this respect, as also in his descriptione ol booles.
