personal independence, in the military chieftains and their sollowcrs,

in the spirituality ol their conceptione of God, and some other lea·

his history ol charles V). All tribes in a rude aud scvage stote
must have many similar uscges and traits of character. And this
resemblance between the well-known habits of our wandering
savagcs and those which T. ascribes to the rudc tribes ol Germsny,
may impressus with confidence in the truthfnlness os his narrative. '
