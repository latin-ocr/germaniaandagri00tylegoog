the application of the cpithet in question, was not a matter οι
necessity or of universal practice. Its omission in this case might
have been occidental, or might hare proceeded from unknown rea-
sona And the bare absence of a single word surely cannot be -
entitled to much wcight, in compariscn with the obvious and
almost neceoeary impert of the passages just cited

Tha primary object of the work is sufficiently obvious It was
to honor the memory of the writer’s excellent father-iulans, Agricola
(eft 3: honori Agricolae, mei soceri, destinatae). So far from
apologizing for writing the life of so near a friend, he fcels assured
that his motivcs will be appreciated and his design approved, how·
ever imperfect may be its execution3 and hedeems an apology neces
sary fcr having so long delayed the performance of that filiai duty.
Alter an introduction of singular beauty and appropriateness (cf.
notes), hc sketchss a brief outline of the parentage, education and

barren parts of the island and eecurcd the Roman province from
the incursione of the more barbarcus inhabitants During these
military enterprises, he neglected not the arta of peace He intro-

man language and manners; instrueted them in letters and science;
and employed every expedient to render those chains which
he had forged both easy and agreeable to them.” (His of ling.
vol. 1.) “

'ihc history of Agricola during this period is of course the his·

of the geographical features, the situation, soil, climate, productione
