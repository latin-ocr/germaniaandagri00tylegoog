bnt the truth, on the subject oi which he treats Moreover, he had
abundant means oi knowing the truth, on all the main points, in the
character and history of the Germana lt has even been argued
from such expression as uidisses (ἓ 8), that Tacitus hed himself been
in Ger-many, and could, therefore, write horn personui observation.

But the argument proceeds cn a misinterpretstion oi his langusge

shows that he derived his information from others But the Ro-
mans had been'in constant intercourse and connection, civil or
military, with the Germane, for two hundred years. Germany iur-
nished a wide theatra for their greatest commandere, and a irnitiul
theme ior their best authors, some oi whom, as Julius Ooesar (to
whom Tacitus particularly refers, 28). were themselves the chiei

tione to the history of Ger-many are now lost (e. g. the elder Pliny, .
who wrote twenty books on the German ware), must have all been
