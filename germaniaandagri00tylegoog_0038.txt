os laconice. No book would give you more ideas in sewer
words. Nowhere could you gain so much knowledge, und
lose so little time. The reader of Tacitus, who will study him
with pen in hund, to mark, or refer to the most stn'king pes·
seges, will soon find himself mester of e text book in moral
and politicel science, we might sey u text book in humen
nature, singularly concise end sententious, end what is not
always true even of concise end sententious writers, as singularly
wise eud proluund. In such a book, meuy ol the speeches would
find a ploce entire3 lor many ul them are little else thau
a series of condensed, welltimcd, end most instructive ·
apothegms.* ’

But the scholar, who is ou the loohout, will find lurhing iu
every section, end ulmost every sentence, some importent truth
in morals, in politice, in the individue] or sociel nature oi man. ,
Neither the editor nor the teacher cen be expected to develope
these sentiments, nor even, in many instances, tc point them
out Thut lebor must be performed by the scholar; and his
will be the reward.

No hnsty perusal, no single teudingus Tacitus, will give u

just conceptiones the surpessing richness of his works. They
must be studied profoundly to be duly appreciated. They are
a mine of wisdom, of vast extent and unknown depth, whose
treesnres lie chiefly beneeth the suriaco, imbedded in the solid
rock witich must be entered with mining implements, explored
with strong lights, und its wenlth brought up by severe teil
und sweet.
