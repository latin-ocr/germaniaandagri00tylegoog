Tacitus was educated ior the ber, and continued to pleat

causes, occasionally at least, and with not a little success,
even aiter he had entered upon the great business cf his lise,
as ιι writer of history. We lind references to his first, and

- perhaps his last appearance, as an advocate, in the letters oi =

Pliny, which are highly complimentary. The first was, when
Pliny was nineteen, and Tacitus ιι little older (how much we
are anciniensi), when Tacitus distinguished himself, so as
to uwalren the emulation and the envy, mougn not in a bad
sense, ci Pliny. The laet was some twenty years later, when
Tacitus and Pliny, the tried friends of a whole life, the brightest

the choice ol the Senate, and pleadsd together at the bar of

the Senam, and in the presence oi the Emperor Trajan, ior

accusati of mel-aduinistraticn in the proconsulship cf Africa.
Pliny says, that Tacitus epoho with singular gravity end
eloquence, and the Sancte passed a unanimous vote oi appro-

betion and thanlrs to both the oratore, t'or the ability and suc·

cess with which they had managed the prosecution (Plin.
Epis. ii. 11).

We have also the comments oi Pliny on a penegyrical
oration, which Tacitus pronounced, when consul, upon his
predecessor iu the consular office, Verginius Rufus, perhaps
the most remarkable man oi his age, distinguished alike as
choro, a statesman‚ and a scholar, and yet so modest cr sc
wise that he repeatedly refused the oil'er oi the imperial purple.

for her last lavor, such un orator to pronounce e eulogium on
such virtues. It was enough to crown the glory of a well
aptent life'’ (Plin. Epis. ii. 1).
