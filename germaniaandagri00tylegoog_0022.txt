PREFACE· 11

tp have been executed, and on whose ripe scholamhip, and
familiarity with the German language and literature, I chiefly
relied forits successful accomplishment

I should not do justice to my feelings, were I to omit the
expression of my obligations to the printer and publishers for
the unwearied patience with which they have labored to perfect
the work, under all the disadvantages attending the 'superin-
tendauce of the prese, at snch a distance. Ii there should still
be found init inaccuracies aud blemishes, it will not be because
they haue spared' any pains to melre it a correct aud beautiful
hook.

It is with unfeigned diffidence that Ι submit to the public this
first attempt at literary labor. 1 arn fully sensible of its
many imperfections‚ at the same time I am consciens of an ability
to make it better at some future day, should it meet the favor·
able regard of the classical teuchers of our land, to whom it is
dedicatedas uu humble contributiou to that cause in which
they are now laboring‚ with such unpreuedented zeel. Shonld
it contribute in any measure to a better understanding, or a
higher appreciation by our youthfnl countrymen of e classic
author, from whom, beyond almost any other, I have drawn in
struction end delight, I shall not have labored in sain.

Mem Callope, June l, 18⁴7.
